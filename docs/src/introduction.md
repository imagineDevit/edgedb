[**EdgeDB**](https://www.edgedb.com/)  is an open-source database designed as a spiritual successor to SQL and the relational paradigm and powered by the postgresql query engine.

 - [TypeScript]()
 - [Golang]()
 - [Deno]()
 - [Python]()
 - [Rust](https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-rust) (_Work still in progress_)
